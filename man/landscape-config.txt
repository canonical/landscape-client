NAME
  landscape-config - configure the Landscape management client

SYNOPSIS
  landscape-config [options]

DESCRIPTION

Before using the landscape-client it must be configured with account and
computer information that is transmitted to the Landscape server when the
client connects. The registration can be performed with or without user
interaction.

Running the landscape-config program without arguments will start the
program, prompting you for the necessary information to run the client.
Optionally you can provide command-line arguments (detailed below) to
specify default responses.

You will be told if the registration was successful or if an error occurred.
When registration is successful Landscape is configured and running on your
system. Errors can occur if you provide incorrect registration details or if
there are network issues. In the latter case, the client will keep trying
to complete the registration in the background.

CLOUD

Landscape has some cloud features that become available when the EC2 or
UEC machine instance was started using Landscape and the AMI is one of
the official ones provided in the Web user interface. We call these 
instances "Landscape enabled", because they contain a pre-configured
landscape-client installed in them which will register the running instance
automatically with Landscape as soon as it starts up.

You can deploy your own AMI, but if you wish the instance to become
"Landscape managed" you need to take a few steps:
* make sure the cloud is created in Landscape
* either add "CLOUD=1" to /etc/default/landscape-client or use the
--cloud switch in the landscape-config(1) command line
* make sure the client is configured to start at boot (i.e., the
/etc/default/landscape-client has the line "RUN=1")

There is no need to further configure the /etc/landscape/client.conf file
with details such as account or key, because when in cloud mode
this is all discovered by the client itself.

You can avoid this all if you just re-bundle the AMIs we provide.
landscape-client is already configured and prepared for the cloud in
them.

EXAMPLES

Register a machine for the first time, or reconfigure an already
registered machine, interactively. Command line parameters suppress
interaction for provided values.

  landscape-config

Register a machine for the first time, or reconfigure an already
registered machine, without requiring user interaction. The client
will be configured to start on boot automatically:

  landscape-config --silent -a account-name -p secret -t `hostname`

Register a machine with the script execution plugin enabled, without
requiring user interaction:

  landscape-config --silent -a account-name -p secret -t `hostname` --script-users nobody,landscape,root

Register a machine with some tags:

  landscape-config --silent -a account-name -p secret -t `hostname` --tags=server,www

To disable a client, stopping current instances and disabling start at
bootup:

  landscape-config --disable
