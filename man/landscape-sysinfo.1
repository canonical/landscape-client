.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBlandscape-sysinfo\fP is a utility that displays information about the computer it is run
on. This information is displayed upon login for console users
(ssh and terminal login supported) and can also be seen at anytime
by just calling \fBlandscape-sysinfo\fP from the command line.
.PP
The output of \fBlandscape-sysinfo\fP can be controlled by enabling or
disabling its plugins. See below how to do that.
.PP
If the system load is higher than the number of cores, as determined by the
count of processor lines in /proc/cpuinfo, then
\fBlandscape-sysinfo\fP will not run at login time. This is to prevent it from
potentially making a bad situation worse by interfering with what could be an
administrator logging in to try to fix the problem causing the high load.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

Any of the long command-line \fIoptions\fP can be used as a configuration directive
in that configuration file, under the section [sysinfo], by replacing the hyphen
(-) with an underscore (_).
.PP
For example, to disable the Network and Temperature plugins
without having to use the command line option, the following can be added to
/etc/landscape/client.conf:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    [sysinfo]
    exclude_sysinfo_plugins = Temperature, Network


.fam T
.fi
.SH EXAMPLES

This is the default configuration with all plugins enabled:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    $ landscape-sysinfo

      System load:    0.66               Processes:             242
      Usage of /home: 72.0% of 27.50GB   Users logged in:       1
      Memory usage:   31%                IP address for wlan0:  10.0.1.6
      Swap usage:     0%                 IP address for virbr0: 192.168.122.1

.SH FILES
/etc/landscape/client.conf
Configuration file
