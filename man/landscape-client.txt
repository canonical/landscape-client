EXAMPLES

To run the client in the foreground, with all logging data printed to standard
I/O:

  landscape-client

To run the client in the background with a particular configuration file:

  landscape-client --config=my.conf --daemon

To run the client in the foreground, with a configuration file, but overriding
the bus option:

  landscape-client --config=my.conf --bus=session

If you want to run the client in non-root mode, please use --monitor-only (or
add it to the config file as monitor_only = True) and add the user you want to
run as to the /etc/default/landscape-client file:

  DAEMON_USER=landscape
