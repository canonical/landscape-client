# GENERAL OPTIONS

# The directory in which landscape-client will store data files in.

# The main URL for the landscape server to connect this client to. If you
# purchased a Landscape Dedicated Server (LDS), change this to point to your
# server instead. This needs to point to the message-system URL.
#
# Please pay special attention to the protocol used here, since it is a common
# source of error.
#
# Example:
#   url = https://landscape.example.com/message-system
url = https://landscape.canonical.com/message-system

# The ping url you want this client to report to.
#
# If you have purchased a Landscape Dedicated Server (LDS), change this to
# point to your server instead.

# Example:

# the impact of restarting the host of multiple landscape-client instances.
# Values range from 0.0 to 1.0, from unstaggered to spreading over
# the full interval.
#
# Default value is 0.1, meaning jobs will start with up to 10% delay

# Example:
#   stagger_launch = 0.5

# landscape-client daemon.
