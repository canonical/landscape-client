"""Bridge client side plugins to the C{MessageExchange}.

The C{BrokerServer} provides C{BrokerClient}s with a mechanism to send messages
to the server and, likewise, triggers those plugins to take action when a
exchange is impending or resynchronisaton is required.

Each C{BrokerClient} has to be registered using the
L{BrokerServer.register_client} method, after which two way communications is
possible between the C{BrokerServer} and the C{BrokerClient}.

Resynchronisation Sequence
==========================

See L{landscape.broker.exchange} sequence diagram for origin of the
"resynchronize-clients" event.

Diagram::


 1. [event 1]               --->  BrokerServer        : Event
                                                      : "resynchronize-clients"

 2. [event 2]               <---  BrokerServer        : Broadcast event
                                                      : "resynchronize"

 3. [optional: various L{BrowserClientPlugin}s respond
               to the "resynchronize" event to reset
               themselves and start report afresh.]

           L{landscape.monitor.activeprocessinfo.ActiveProcessInfo} )


 4. [event 1]               ---> MessageExchange      : Event
    (NOTE, this is the same event as step 1           : "resynchronize-clients"
     it is handled by both BrokerServer and
     MessageExchange.
     See MessageExchange._resynchronize )

 5. MessageExchange         ---> MessageExchange      : Schedule urgent
                                                      : exchange

        IDs must be passed to L{send_message} whenever sending a message.

        The broker keeps track of the session IDs that it hands out and will
        drop them when a re-synchronisation event occurs.  Further messages

        For example each L{BrokerClientPlugin} calls this method to get a
