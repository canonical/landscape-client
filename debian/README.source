When making a revision to this package, please update the *last* digit in the
Debian version number. e.g.

  1.0.29-0ubuntu0.9.04.0

should become

  1.0.29-0ubuntu0.9.04.1

In addition, when you build a package for a new client version, it would be
appreciated if you also updated the UPSTREAM_VERSION variable in
landscape/__init__.py to include the entire new client version number. This
helps us keep track of exact version of clients in use. There's no need to
update the DEBIAN_REVISION variable, as it gets automatically set at build
time.
