landscape-client (18.01-0ubuntu1) bionic; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 18.01:
    - Ported to python3 (LP: #1577850)
    - move Replaces/Breaks landscape-client-ui rules to landscape-common
      (LP: #1560424)
    - Add a libpam-systemd Depends if built for xenial (LP: #1590838)
    - Some units not reporting swift usage (LP: #1588404)
    - Fix missing install directories for landscape-common and drop
      usr/share/landscape as its only used and created by landscape-client.
      (LP: #1680842)
    - Fix VM detection for Xen, by returning "xen" only for paravirtualized and
      HVM hosts, not for dom0. (LP: #1601818)
    - Add an indication of truncation to process output that has been truncated
      prior to delivery to the server. (LP: #1629000)
    - add /snap/bin to the PATH when executing scripts. (LP: #1635634)
    - Save the original sources.list file when a repository profile is
      associated with a computer and restore it when the profile is removed.
      (LP: #1607529)
    - Drop the legacy HAService plugin, which is no longer used.
    - Avoid double-decoding package descriptions in build_skeleton_apt, which
      causes an error with Xenial python-apt. (LP: #1655395)
    - Remove dead dbus code and textmessage (confirmed not supported in server
      for ~2 years). (LP: #1657372)
    - Move bzr-builddeb conf file from deprecated location to debian/
      (LP: #1658796)
    - Support for new server error message about there being too many pending
      computers already (LP: #1662530)
    - Add a timestamp to the package reporter result (LP: #1674252)
    - Check if ubuntu-release-upgrader is running before apt-update (LP: #1699179)
    - Implicitly trust file-local sources managed by landscape. On upgrades,
      add the trusted flag to the landscape file-local apt source file if it's
      not there. (LP: #1736576)
    - Use local system tools to change the user's password (LP: #1743558)
  * clean up packaging and getting in sync with the new landscape version:
    - d/rules: drop extra:suggests which is unused since 13.07.1-0ubuntu2
    - Remove antique postinst code. No supported landscape-client version
      installs cronjobs anymore (since a long time).
    - d/landscape-client.docs: the README file is now a markdown file, so
      install that instead.
    - d/landscape-common.postinst: no need to single out
      /var/lib/landscape/.gnupg when fixing ownerships, just do it over
      the entire parent directory.
    - guard user and group removal via an empty .cleanup.* file in post, so we
      only remove the user/group if we were the ones who created them at
      install time.
    - lintian: remove absolute path from update-motd calls in maintainer
      scripts
    - d/rules: drop special handling for dapper, hardy and lucid, which are no
      longer supported.
    - d/rules: make sure we have an "extra:Depends=" in substvars even if it's
      empty
    - d/rules: drop dh_pycentral handling, it's obsolete
  * Dropped (already included in this version):
    - d/p/set-vm-info-to-kvm-for-aws-C5-instances.patch:
      Sets vm_info to kvm for new AWS EC2 C5 instances. (LP #1742531)
    - d/p/set-vm-info-to-kvm-for-digitalocean-instances.patch:
      Sets vm_info to kvm for digitalocean instances. (LP #1743232)
    - Add proxy handling to package reporter. (LP #1531150)
    - Fix regression in configuration hook under install-cd chroot (LP #1699789)
    - Report autoremovable packages (LP #1208393)
    - Do not re-register client by default (LP #1618483)
    - Don't report packages that are coming from backports, so that Landscape
      doesn't try to upgrade to versions of packages that are in backports.
      (LP #1668583)
    - Cope with an api change in python-swift that broke swift storage
      reporting in Autopilot. (LP #1563565)

  * New release: 13.07.3
    - The metadata.d/ directory was renamed to annotations.d/ (LP: #1226087)
    - Metadata exchange mechanism now uses the less ambiguous term
      "annotations" instead of "metadata". (LP: #1226597)

landscape-client (13.07.1-0ubuntu2) saucy; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (LP: #1190510)
   - New metadata exchange mechanism allows clients to send any key-value data
     to the landscape server (LP: #1123932)
   - Network devices now report their maximum theoretical speeds, and duplex
     status to landscape-server (LP: #1126330, LP: #1130130)
   - Landscape.client is now HA aware when HA is implemented using juju
     charms (LP: #1122508)
   - The landscape client will now trigger a reboot if server sends a
     reboot-required message. (LP: #1133005)
   - Big AMP code cleanup and refactoring in order to improve testing, improve
     performance and ease future maintainability (LP: #1165047, LP: #1169102,
     LP: #1170669, LP: #1170669, LP: #1170669, LP: #1170669, LP: #1170669,
     LP: #1170669, LP: #1170669, LP: #1170669, LP: #1170669)
   - Added logic to detect cloned (virtual) computers (LP: #1161856)
   - The landscape-client and landscape-common packages do not use or depend
     on dbus code anymore, and the dependencies to python-gi and gudev are
     dropped. The hardware info plugin now looks at /proc instead of querying
     DBus (LP: #1175553, LP: #1180691)
   - The ceph manager plugin is now a monitor plugin and thus does not require
     root privileges anymore. (LP: #1186973)
   - The detection logic for virtual machine was changed to account for the
     different semantics between Openstack Folsom and Grizzly, and was
     expanded to detect more hypervisors (LP: #1191843)
   - Removed legacy upgrader code from postinst since support for it was
     dropped.
   - French translation patches were removed since the changes were merged
     upstream.
   - Removed legacy upgrader from postinst.
   - The /etc/dbus-1/system.d/landscape.conf file was moved from the
     landscape-common package to the landscape-client-ui as part of
     LP: #1175553, LP: #1180691. The added "Replaces:" stanza does not need
     an equivalent "Breaks:" since packages depend on each other with a
     strictly equal version number, avoiding the case described in 
     http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/footnotes.html#f53

  * New upstream release 12.05 (r561 in trunk) (LP: #1004678).
  * Make all subpackages that depend on each other require the exact same
    version, instead of >= $version.
  * Added python-gi to client depends starting natty.
  * Make change-packages also handle package holds (LP: #972489).
  * Fix typo in glade file (LP: #983096).
  * Tidy up apt facade (LP: #985493).
  * Remove SmartFacade and its tests, no longer used (LP: #996269).
  * Remove check for apt version, since we won't release this for
    Hardy where that check matters (LP: #996837).
  * Remove methods that were smart specific. We no longer use smart
    (LP: #996841).
  * Remove smart-update helper binary. We no longer use smart
    (LP: #997408).
  * Remove test-mixins that were useful only during the apt-to-smart
    code migration. Now with smart gone, they are no longer necessary
    (LP: #997760).
  * Build the packages from precise onward, not just precise.
  * Assorted packaging fixes:
    - Switched to format 3.0 (quilt).
    - Added source lintian overrides, with comments.
    - Updated debian/rules:
      - Added build-arch and build-indep dummy target.
      - Build the GUI packages from precise onwards, and not just on precise.
      - Re-enable dh_lintian.
      - Strip the binaries (dh_strip), and also call dh_shlibdeps for the
        automatic shlibs dependency.
      - Added python-gi from natty onwards.
    - Used __Choices instead of _Choices in landscape-common.templates, it's
      better for translators.
    - Updated standard version to 3.8.2, the version from Lucid (oldest one
      we support)
    - Added shlibs depends.
    - Dropped deprecated ${Source-Version} and replaced it with
      ${binary:Version}
    - Require exact version of the sibling package instead of >=.

  * Fix default landscape hostname in glib schema.
  * dpkg test improvements to fix intermittent failures.
  * If ssl_public_key is supplied, use it also when fetching script
    attachments. This fixes the case of using script execution with
    attachments when the Landscape server is using a custom CA,
    most common in LDS deployments. (LP: #959846)
  * Make sure we have a PATH variable set before doing package
    activities, and also set it in the initscript for good measure. If
    the client was configured and restarted by the new UI configuration
    tool, PATH wasn't set, triggering an error in dpkg. (LP: #961190)
  * Make landscape-client-ui depend on landscape-client-ui-install, so
    that we get an entry in the system settings if just
    landscape-client-ui is installed. The actual entry comes from
    landscape-client-ui-install.
  * Optimization: when adding binaries, don't reload every repo, only the one
    containing the binaries. (LP: #954822)
  * Handle the case where the user clicks twice inadvertently on the
    Landscape icon in system settings and don't start a second copy of
    itself. (LP: #960211)

  * Allow the client to accept arbitrary environment variables from the
    server for script execution (LP: #954999).
  * Make landscape-config exit non-zero when registration fails and 
    --ok-no-register is not passed (LP: #271759).
  * Check for the content of /sys/bus/xen/devices to report a machine as a Xen
    VM instead of just relying on the existence of /sys/bus/xen (LP: #921970).
  * Make sure cloud registration succeeds if there is no kernel specified in

  * Memory consumption has is improved.  The client's functionality is
    now broken up into a number of sub-processes.  Functionality that
    would previously use or leak memory, such as package management,
    run in independent processes that exit when they complete so the
    OS can reclaim the memory.
  * Security is improved with this design.  Monitoring plugins run as
    the unpriviledged landscape user while management functions run as
    root.
  * Secure inter-process communication occurs over DBUS.
