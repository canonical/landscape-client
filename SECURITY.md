# Security policy

To report a security issue, file a [Private Security Report](https://github.com/canonical/landscape-client/security/advisories/new) or send an email to [security@ubuntu.com](mailto:security@ubuntu.com) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.
